Dear Dr.\ Lemberger and anonymous reviewers,

We thank you for reviewing our manuscript on SBML Level~3 and providing many thoughtful comments and suggestions.  They helped us improve the manuscript.  

Included with this submission is a point-by-point explanation of our responses to the reviewers' comments, with an appended version of the manuscript that shows detailed differences between the manuscript of July 2019 and the new version.  The differences include additional minor corrections and updates beyond the changes made for reviewer feedback, which we have done in an effort to improve the manuscript further (for example, by reducing the overall number of citations and improving overall text cohesion).

To the extent possible, we have endeavored to address all of the issues.  We hope that the reviewers' concerns have been addressed adequately and that the manuscript is now ready for publication.
